# Previous Documentation Versions

This directory contains previous versions of documentation files for the Talemo project. These files are archived here to maintain a historical record of how the project documentation has evolved over time.

## Overview

As documentation is updated, previous versions are moved to this directory to preserve the history of changes while keeping the main documentation directory focused on the most current information.

## File Structure

- `product-requirements.v1.md`: Version 1 of the product requirements document
- `product-requirements.v1.feedback.md`: Feedback on version 1 of the product requirements
- `product-requirements.v2.md`: Version 2 of the product requirements document
- `product-requirements.v2.feedback.md`: Feedback on version 2 of the product requirements
- `technical-implementation.v1.md`: Version 1 of the technical implementation document

## Versioning Convention

The versioning convention used for documentation files is:
- `filename.vX.md` for the main document version X
- `filename.vX.feedback.md` for feedback on version X

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference Previous Versions

Previous versions of documentation may be useful in the following scenarios:
- Understanding the evolution of product requirements
- Reviewing historical design decisions
- Referencing features that were planned but later modified or removed
- Tracking changes in technical implementation approaches

### How to Reference Previous Versions

When referencing previous versions in current documentation or discussions:
1. Clearly indicate that you are referencing a previous version
2. Specify the version number and document name
3. If possible, link directly to the specific file in this directory

Example:
```markdown
As outlined in [product-requirements.v1.md](../previous-versions/product-requirements.v1.md), the initial approach was to...
```

## Archiving Process

When creating a new version of a document:

1. Move the current version to this directory
2. If applicable, also move any associated feedback documents
3. Create the new version in the main documentation directory
4. Update any references to the document in other documentation or code

## Retention Policy

All previous versions are retained indefinitely unless:
- They contain sensitive information that should not be preserved
- They are superseded by more than three newer versions and contain no historically significant information
